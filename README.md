# QuantumWatch - Real-time System Performance Monitoring

QuantumWatch provides a robust and efficient solution for monitoring system performance metrics in real-time. This tool allows developers and system administrators to gain deep insights into CPU utilization, memory usage, network activity, disk I/O, and process-level performance, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks. Built with TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability, QuantumWatch offers a flexible and scalable architecture suitable for diverse operational environments.

QuantumWatch is designed to be easily integrated into existing infrastructure. Its modular design allows users to selectively enable or disable specific monitoring modules, tailoring the tool to their specific needs. The real-time data visualization capabilities provide immediate feedback on system health, facilitating quicker response times to critical events. By leveraging asynchronous processing and efficient data aggregation techniques, QuantumWatch minimizes its own resource footprint while delivering maximum monitoring coverage.

The primary benefit of using QuantumWatch is the ability to proactively identify and address performance issues before they impact end-users. By providing comprehensive real-time data, QuantumWatch empowers teams to make data-driven decisions, optimize system configurations, and improve overall application performance. Furthermore, the customizable alerting system ensures that critical issues are immediately brought to the attention of the appropriate personnel. QuantumWatch is a valuable asset for any organization that prioritizes system stability and performance.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time CPU Utilization Monitoring:** Provides granular insights into CPU usage across all cores, including user, system, and idle time. Implemented using Node.js's `os.cpus()` function and calculated differentials for accurate percentage readings.
*   **Memory Usage Tracking:** Monitors total, used, and free memory, as well as swap space utilization. Employs `os.totalmem()` and `os.freemem()` for fetching memory statistics.
*   **Network I/O Monitoring:** Tracks network traffic by interface, including packets sent and received, bytes transferred, and error counts. Utilizes system-level network interfaces information obtained through the `os` module and calculates delta values for reporting rates.
*   **Disk I/O Performance:** Monitors disk read and write speeds, as well as disk space utilization. Leverages the `fs` module for file system statistics and calculates throughput based on block sizes and operation counts.
*   **Process Monitoring:** Lists all running processes with key metrics such as CPU usage, memory footprint, and process ID (PID). Uses the `child_process` module in conjunction with system commands like `ps` for extracting process information.
*   **Customizable Alerting:** Allows users to define thresholds for various metrics and receive alerts when those thresholds are exceeded. Implemented using a rule-based engine that evaluates incoming data against defined alert criteria.
*   **Data Visualization:** Presents monitoring data in a clear and intuitive manner using charts and graphs. Utilizes a charting library such as Chart.js to create dynamic visualizations of performance metrics.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Used as the primary programming language for enhanced type safety, code organization, and maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** Provides the runtime environment for executing the monitoring application.
*   **os (Node.js Module):** Offers operating system-related utility methods, used for fetching CPU, memory, and network information.
*   **fs (Node.js Module):** Provides methods for interacting with the file system, used for disk I/O monitoring.
*   **child_process (Node.js Module):** Enables the execution of system commands for process monitoring.
*   **Chart.js (or similar):** A JavaScript charting library used for creating data visualizations.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the QuantumWatch repository from GitHub using the following command:
    git clone https://github.com/uhsr/QuantumWatch.git
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
    cd QuantumWatch
4.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required npm packages by running:
    npm install
5.  **Build the Project:** Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript by executing:
    npm run build

## Configuration

QuantumWatch utilizes environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the following variables:

*   `MONITORING_INTERVAL`: The interval (in milliseconds) at which the system is monitored. Default: 1000.
*   `ALERT_CPU_THRESHOLD`: CPU utilization threshold (percentage) for triggering alerts. Default: 90.
*   `ALERT_MEMORY_THRESHOLD`: Memory utilization threshold (percentage) for triggering alerts. Default: 90.

You can modify the `config.ts` file for more granular settings related to data aggregation and visualization.

## Usage

1.  **Start the Application:** After installation and configuration, start the QuantumWatch application by running:
    npm start
2.  **Access the Web Interface:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration) to view the real-time monitoring data.
3.  **API Documentation (Example):** While a full API would depend on specific implementation, an example data fetch could be accessed at `/api/metrics`. This endpoint would return a JSON object containing real-time metrics. Implement error handling and proper data serialization.
